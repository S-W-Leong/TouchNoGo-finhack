# Fraud Ops Market Research: Unit21-Like Platforms

Research date: 2026-04-25
Repo: `tng-hackathon-2026-personal`
Focus: `Security & Fraud`
Method: official vendor product pages, product docs, vendor case studies, the Unit21 screenshots you provided, and repo context.

## Executive Summary

The strongest reading of this market is not "fraud detection startups."

It is:

- fraud and AML operations platforms
- risk decisioning systems
- analyst workbenches
- graph and entity investigation tools
- case management and reporting systems
- increasingly, AI-assisted triage and workflow layers

Unit21 is a good anchor because it sits in the middle of that category. It is not just a model vendor and not just a sanctions data vendor. It is a fraud/AML operations platform with rule authoring, alert handling, graph investigation, case actions, and now AI-assisted investigation.

The market is converging around a common stack:

1. real-time detection and scoring
2. no-code rule/workflow management
3. alert prioritization and routing
4. entity/network investigation
5. case management with audit trails
6. AML/sanctions/screening add-ons or full FRAML convergence
7. AI to reduce manual review, draft narratives, and recommend actions

What real fraud ops teams actually want is much narrower than what vendors pitch:

- fewer false positives
- faster triage
- one screen with full context
- the ability to change controls without engineering tickets
- safe testing before production
- graph or entity linkage that changes decisions, not just a pretty diagram
- immediate analyst actions like hold, step-up, escalate, freeze, suspend, or export
- regulator-ready notes, audit trails, and filings

That means the TNG hackathon direction should stay exactly where the repo is already drifting:

- not another dashboard
- not just AML screening
- not just a score
- build the pre-payout decision workspace above existing controls

## Scope

This memo is intentionally focused on the current vendor cluster most relevant to a TNG `Security & Fraud` build:

- Unit21
- Sardine
- Hawk
- Feedzai
- Flagright
- ComplyAdvantage
- SEON
- DataVisor
- Alloy
- Oscilar
- Sift
- Featurespace

Adjacent players also worth noting:

- Lucinity
- Tookitaki
- Effectiv / Socure RiskOS

This is not every company touching risk, identity, KYC, cybersecurity, or trust and safety. It is the most relevant set for a `Unit21-like` fraud ops product thesis.

## What "Unit21-like" Actually Means

A Unit21-like product is not one thing. It is a stack.

### Layer 1: Detection and control plane

- rules
- thresholds
- matchlists
- device and behavior signals
- risk scores
- transaction monitoring
- watchlist and sanctions screening
- alert scoring
- backtesting or sandboxing

### Layer 2: Investigation and operations plane

- queues
- assignments
- entity resolution
- graph and network analysis
- case notes
- evidence collection
- collaboration
- QA workflows
- escalations
- action buttons

### Layer 3: Compliance and audit plane

- SAR / STR / CTR narratives
- regulatory filing
- audit logs
- explainability
- policy mapping
- 4-eye review
- approval tracking

### Layer 4: AI layer

- AI rule generation
- AI triage
- AI summaries
- AI alert prioritization
- AI investigation prep
- AI narrative drafting
- AI rule optimization

The most important market pattern in 2026 is that the best vendors do not sell AI as a magic fraud oracle. They sell AI as leverage inside the ops loop.

## What the Unit21 Screenshots Show

Your screenshots are useful because they show the actual operator surface, not just homepage copy.

### Observed Unit21 features from the screenshots

- Detection modeling dashboard with deployed models, alert review rate, and flagged amount.
- Graph-based rule/scenario builder where entities can be linked by shared attributes.
- Shared-attribute graph rules across IP address, phone number, email, instrument, client fingerprint, SSN, name fields, date of birth, physical ID, geolocation, and bank account.
- Dynamic rule builder with named variables and trigger conditions.
- Transaction rule builder with standard threshold conditions like amount and sender risk score.
- Matchlist-based screening logic such as `ip_address is in High Risk Countries`.
- Relative or baseline rules like amount greater than a percentage of average amount over a trailing time window.
- Alert summary page with status, disposition, assignments, workflow actions, and flagged entities.
- Network analysis graph centered on linked entities, not isolated alerts.
- Alert score explanation with variable-level contribution bars.
- Analyst action rail with actions like `Clear - False Positive`, `Close - No Decision`, `Confirm - True Positive`, `Create Case`, `Escalate to L2`, and `Suspend Customer`.
- AI-assisted rule authoring and explanation panels in later dark-theme screenshots.
- AI-generated rule descriptions and recommendations.
- Variable editor for aggregation logic like number of unique counterparties over a time window.

### Why these screenshots matter

They show what ops software looks like when it is actually built for investigators:

- controls and investigations in the same product
- graph and scoring tied to analyst decisions
- case actions next to evidence
- rules that are editable by risk teams
- AI positioned as a helper to author, explain, or accelerate, not as a mysterious black box

That is a much stronger product reference than generic "fraud AI" marketing.

| AI rule generation / recommendations | Unit21 screenshots, Sardine, SEON, Oscilar, Effectiv | Useful when it remains editable and testable. |
| Bulk ops / queue ops / routing | Unit21 screenshots, Sardine, Flagright, SEON, Oscilar, Sift, Socure RiskOS | Real ops teams need workload management, not just individual views. |
| Action layer | Unit21 screenshots, Hawk, Alloy, Sift | A system that can only alert is weaker than one that can hold, step-up, or route action. |

## What Actual Fraud Ops Teams Want

This is the important section.

The clearest operator signal across the market is that fraud ops teams do not want "more AI." They want less waste.

### Tier 1: Hard operational needs

#### 1. Fewer false positives

This is the single loudest theme across almost every vendor.

Why:

- false positives waste analyst time
- good customers get blocked
- queues become unmanageable
- noisy systems hide true risk

Evidence:

- Unit21 alert scoring is explicitly about prioritizing investigator time and reducing false-positive burden.
- Hawk, Flagright, Feedzai, and ComplyAdvantage all push false-positive reduction as a core value prop.
- Sift talks directly about keeping review queues manageable.

#### 2. One place to see the whole case

Fraud ops teams hate swivel-chair investigations.

They want:

- transactions
- customer profile
- device history
- network links
- triggered rules
- past decisions
- notes
- watchlist results
- activity timeline

all in one screen.

This is repeated across Unit21, Sardine, Hawk, Flagright, SEON, Alloy, DataVisor, and Lucinity.

#### 3. Rules they can change themselves

Real teams do not want to wait for:

- engineering sprints
- vendor support tickets
- SQL changes
- model deployment cycles

They want:

- no-code builders
- editable thresholds
- templates
- natural language shortcuts
- test environments

This is why the best modern vendors emphasize self-serve rules, workflows, and sandbox testing.

#### 4. Safe testing before rollout

Mature ops teams want to know:

- how much volume a rule will fire
- what precision/recall tradeoff it introduces
- whether it hits good customers
- whether it creates alert floods

This is why shadow mode, simulation, A/B testing, and backtesting matter so much.

#### 5. Graph and entity linkage that changes action

A graph by itself is not enough.

Ops teams want graph tools that help them:

- merge related alerts
- see mule rings
- link shared devices/IPs/emails
- act on a whole network
- escalate unified cases

DataVisor is especially strong here because its case studies explicitly describe moving from isolated alerts to cluster-level decisions.

#### 6. Clear next actions

Investigators do not want to end on "risk score = 83."

They want the system to support decisions like:

- allow
- watch
- step-up
- hold
- freeze
- suspend
- escalate
- file SAR
- create case
- close as false positive

The Unit21 screenshots are especially good evidence here.

#### 7. Audit trail and regulator-ready output

Any serious fraud/AML ops stack eventually needs:

- notes
- evidence trail
- case history
- filed report history
- rationale
- QA
- approvals

This is why case management, SAR drafting, and audit logs show up almost everywhere.

#### 8. Team workflow controls

Operators want more than a case view. They want:

- assignment
- queue segmentation
- auto-routing
- SLAs
- workload balancing
- checklists
- QA sampling
- 4-eye review

This is ops software, not just detection software.

### Tier 2: Strong wants

#### 1. AI for repetitive work

The strongest AI use cases in this market are:

- alert triage
- evidence gathering
- entity research
- case summaries
- narrative drafting
- rule suggestions

These are strong because they compress manual work without removing the human decision maker.

#### 2. Identity + behavior + transaction context together

Alloy, SEON, Sardine, Feedzai, and Oscilar all emphasize that transactions alone are not enough.

This matters for:

- account takeover
- scam intervention
- mule behavior
- synthetic IDs
- payout abuse

#### 3. Feedback loops

Good fraud ops teams want the platform to learn from:

- labels
- dispositions
- closed cases
- rule outcomes

This shows up in Unit21, SEON, DataVisor, Feedzai, Oscilar, and Sardine.

### Tier 3: Nice-to-have or hype-prone

#### 1. Generic "AI agent" language without clear workflow hooks

If the AI cannot show:

- what evidence it used
- what action it recommends
- what policy it mapped to
- what human can override

it is probably demo theater.

#### 2. Beautiful dashboards without operator actions

Dashboards are easy to show and easy to overbuild.

Fraud ops teams care more about:

- action speed
- review burden
- queue health
- filing speed
- false-positive suppression

#### 3. Graph visualizations with no case workflow

If the graph does not change routing, escalation, or action, it is mostly eye candy.

## What Fraud Ops Teams Do Not Actually Want

- another flat alert queue with better colors
- a black-box score with no explanation
- a graph view disconnected from decisions
- a rules engine that requires engineers for every change
- AI summaries that do not cite evidence
- separate tools for fraud, AML, sanctions, and case notes if the same analyst has to open all of them
- more "investigate later" surfaces with no hold, step-up, or enforcement path
- a screening product that floods the team with unresolved near-matches

## What Is Commodity in 2026

- real-time rules engine
- case queues
- sanctions screening
- device intelligence claims
- AI summaries
- no-code workflow builder
- ML risk scores

These are no longer enough to differentiate by themselves.

## What Still Differentiates

### 1. Fraud + AML convergence that actually changes workflow

Not just shared branding.

Real differentiation is:

- shared cases
- shared entity graph
- unified actioning
- unified filing and audit trail

### 2. Network-level decisioning

The strongest vendors are moving from:

- one alert

to:

- one network
- one cluster
- one coordinated abuse pattern

### 3. Safe control tuning

Simulator, shadow mode, A/B tests, backtests, and route metrics matter because they let teams move fast without breaking good-user experience.

### 4. Identity-aware lifecycle monitoring

The better products connect:

- onboarding
- login
- account changes
- payouts
- counterparty behavior
- AML risk

instead of only watching final transactions.

### 5. Explainability tied to action

The best experience is not:

- "score 63"

It is:

- "hold because of device change + near-watchlist beneficiary + sudden cross-border payout + dormant wallet reactivation; here is the evidence"

### 6. Human-in-the-loop AI

The winning pattern is:

- AI compresses manual work
- human owns high-risk decisions
- full audit trail is preserved

## Best Product Lessons for TNG

If the goal is to win `Security & Fraud`, the research points to a very clear product shape.

## What to build

Build:

- a pre-payout decision workspace
- one hero case
- one operator queue
- one investigation graph
- one action rail
- one export-ready note
- one replay or simulator moment

## Must-have MVP features

### 1. Queue prioritization

Show:

- highest-risk cases first
- reason chips
- risk level
- next recommended action

### 2. One-screen case workspace

Put in one view:

- facts
- AI inferences
- timeline
- linked entities
- device / beneficiary / counterparty context
- triggered controls
- analyst notes

### 3. Action rail

At minimum:

- allow
- step-up
- hold
- escalate
- export note

If the system cannot lead to action, it will feel incomplete.

### 4. Fact vs inference separation

This is essential for trust.

Show:

- confirmed signals
- inferred risk
- missing information

separately.

### 5. Network view

The graph should do more than look cool.

Use it to explain:

- shared IP
- shared beneficiary
- shared device
- shared merchant
- near-watchlist link

### 6. Rule or policy replay

This is one of the sharpest differentiators in the repo already.

Show:

- current threshold
- stricter threshold
- tradeoff between caught bad payments and delayed good payments

### 7. Audit-ready note export

Even a lightweight case note or SAR-style draft makes the system feel real.

### 8. Human-in-the-loop proof

Be explicit:

- AI recommends
- human approves
- action is logged

## Nice-to-have if time allows

- AI-generated rule suggestion
- screening false-positive suppression
- QA checklist
- junior vs senior queue routing
- direct step-up user intervention view

## What to avoid

- a generic AML screen as the homepage
- five disconnected pages for different tools
- a graph tab with no operational consequence
- vague "AI found risk" copy
- multi-cloud architecture that does not visibly matter

## My Blunt Read on the Market

The market has already decided that:

- rules alone are not enough
- ML alone is not enough
- alerts alone are not enough
- case management alone is not enough

The winning category is:

- detection
- plus investigation
- plus action
- plus reporting
- plus safe tuning

inside one operating system for risk teams.

That is why your repo's current direction is stronger than the original `AML + sanctions screener` idea.

The better question is not:

- "Can we screen better?"

It is:

- "Can we help an analyst decide faster, with better evidence, before money leaves?"

That is the right `Security & Fraud` wedge.

## Suggested TNG Product Sentence

Use something close to this:

`TNG RiskOps Agent is an AI-native pre-payout decision workspace that turns fraud and AML alerts into evidence-backed actions, analyst-ready case notes, and replayable policy tradeoffs.`

## Suggested Demo Arc

1. Show one dangerous payout case.
2. Show why the case is risky across transaction, device, beneficiary, and watchlist context.
3. Show the network view.
4. Show the recommended action.
5. Show the analyst making the decision.
6. Show the export-ready note.
7. Show the replay lab changing a policy threshold and the caught-vs-friction tradeoff.

## Office-Hours Wedge Test

Using the `office-hours` forcing-question lens, the best wedge here is even narrower than "fraud ops."

### 1. Who is the desperate user?

Not "the bank."

It is:

- the fraud analyst
- the AML investigator
- the risk operations lead

specifically when money is about to move and they have to make a decision fast.

### 2. What is the hated status quo?

- too many alerts
- weak prioritization
- evidence gathering spread across tools
- graph work disconnected from actioning
- rule changes that are slow to test safely
- post-hoc notes and reporting that steal analyst time

### 3. What is the narrowest wedge?

Not:

- generic AML monitoring
- generic fraud detection
- broad customer safety

The narrowest wedge is:

- `high-risk pre-payout decisioning for suspicious wallet or cross-border movements`

That is why the repo's `case-301` direction is strong.

### 4. What is the non-obvious observation?

The market does not actually need another detector.

It needs:

- a system that compresses the time from signal to decision
- while preserving evidence, explainability, and human control

### 5. Why now?

Because AI is finally useful for the boring, expensive parts of fraud ops:

- triage
- research
- summarization
- rule drafting
- filing prep

but the decision itself still benefits from human approval.

### 6. What expands after the wedge works?

If the wedge works, expansion paths are obvious:

- more scam patterns
- more payment rails
- more AML and sanctions coverage
- direct customer rescue moments
- policy simulator and governance tooling

That expansion path is much healthier than starting broad and hoping to find focus later.

## Final Call

The best product to build for this repo is not:

- a better alert table
- a pure sanctions screener
- a black-box risk model

It is:

- an analyst operating system for pre-payout fraud and AML decisions

That is where the market is going, and that is the strongest story for TNG's `Security & Fraud` track.
